# Gray Scott 2D Diffusion

This little project is essentially a conversion of the original Fortran Gray Scott Coursework for my scientific computing module over to C++ with the express purpose of learning C++ and also making pretty gifs of Turing patterns because I like them.

Also trying to be more consistent with my version control + testing and just generally be a bit better with software development especially personal projects.

Hopefully this project will be a jumping off point for more advanced numerical PDE solutions using FEM and FireDrake (maybe?).
Ideally will eventually attempt to approximate solutions with Diffusion Models but it will be a while before that happens because I like to think I have a life. Once the project is done there will be pretty pictures and gifs and that's all I need!
